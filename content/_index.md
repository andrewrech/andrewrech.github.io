I am a clinical pathology resident in the physician-scientist pathway at the University of Pennsylvania. I research basic and translational tumor immunology, using mouse models of cancer, patient tissue analysis, and systems approaches to improve immune therapy for cancer. In the past, I have studied the immunobiology of radiation, regulatory T cells, tumor antigenicity, and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. My current basic research focus is investigating the genetic and transcriptomic determinants of immune heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer metastasis. My translational focus is using tumor and immune biomarkers to build a real-time predictive model of response to immune checkpoint blockade.
